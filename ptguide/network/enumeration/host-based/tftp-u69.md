# TFTP - U69

{% hint style="info" %}
Performs file transfers between client and server processes. However, it does not provide user authentication and other valuable features supported by FTP. In addition, while FTP uses TCP, TFTP uses UDP, making it an unreliable protocol and causing it to use UDP-assisted application layer recovery.
